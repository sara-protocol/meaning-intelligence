**Meaning Intelligence is the *directional regulation* of other intelligent activities.** It is not a fourth kind of intelligence standing alongside logical, computational, and perceptual intelligence, but a *meta-layer* above them that constrains their direction. Its question is not *"can it be done"* but *"is it worth doing — worth it for whom, and at what scale?"*

## What This Theory Does NOT Claim



This theory is most easily misread as a manifesto of the form "AI gives answers, only humans create meaning". It is **not**. To avoid that battlefield, here is an explicit list of its boundaries.



### ❌ This theory does NOT claim



- that humans possess exclusive access to meaning

- that AI cannot participate in meaning processes

- that meaning is subjective preference alone

- that all intelligent systems require human supervision

- that the six-layer stack is the only valid decomposition

- that the theory is empirically confirmed



### ✅ This theory DOES claim



- intelligence requires directional regulation

- meaning judgments can be structurally analyzed

- value and boundary are parts of directional judgment

- multi-scale meaning creates coordination problems

- recursive review may be necessary for long-horizon stability

- the claims above are **testable and falsifiable**

## Construct Boundaries



**This project's "Meaning Intelligence" is a specific naming.** As of 2026, `Meaning Intelligence` is already in use across several directions — semantic/pragmatic analysis, decision support, and commercial products among them. This project's **Meaning Intelligence Theory (MIT)** refers to **the directional regulation of intelligent activities**. It is not identical to any of the following adjacent constructs.



| Adjacent construct | Concerns | Relation to this project |

|---|---|---|

| **IQ / EQ / SQ** | Can it compute / get along / coexist | Parallel capabilities; this theory **sits above them** to constrain direction |

| **Semantic / Pragmatic Intelligence** | Context, intent, irony, coded subtext in language | Handles **meaning in language**; this theory handles **direction of action** |

| **Decision Intelligence** | Coherent understanding from information + context + human judgment | Application-layer framework; this theory provides the **meta-layer structure** |

| **Metacognitive AI** | Self-monitoring, resource allocation, difficulty estimation | Adjacent to L6; L6 is **one layer of the stack** |

| **AI Alignment** | Aligning AI behavior with human values | Provides **structure for directional judgment**; does not replace alignment research |

| **Wisdom / Judgment traditions** | Practical wisdom, judgment | This theory attempts to **formalize** them into testable structure |



> **Naming conflict statement**: This project does not claim exclusivity over the term `Meaning Intelligence`. We do explicitly distinguish: this project's "Meaning Intelligence Theory" refers to **directional regulation**, which is a **different construct** from same-named usage in semantic, pragmatic, or decision-oriented directions.

## The Six-Layer Stack



The six layers fall into **three bands** by cognitive distance:



| Band | Layer | Name | Solves |

|---|---|---|---|

| **Interface** | L1 | Cognitive Load Reduction | *Information cannot get in* |

| **Interface** | L2 | Experiential Rendering | *Information cannot get in* |

| **Processing** | L3 | Meaning Generation | *Meaning cannot get out* |

| **Processing** | L4 | Value Assessment | *Meaning cannot get out* |

| **Meta** | L5 | Direction Selection | *Direction cannot be held* |

| **Meta** | L6 | Recursive Reflection and Review | *Direction cannot be held* |



**Only the meta band can rewrite the premises of the layers below it** — this is the formal signature of "meta".



L6's output is written back as L1's input. The six layers form a **closed spiral**, not a one-way pipeline.



> ### ⚠️ A note on the stack itself

>

> The six-layer stack is an **integrative structure** at evidence level **E0 (conceptual)**. It has not been independently tested. Treat it as a **testable organizing tool**, not a confirmed finding. If a simpler partition with greater explanatory power emerges, it should **replace** this one.
